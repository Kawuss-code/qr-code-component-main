# Qr code component

## About me
Hi!
It's one of my first projects I hosted on GitHub.
I did many small projects in my school but they are usually focused on the mechanizm not on the good looking side so I won't post it here. They are usually written in JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP and some other projects using databases like MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL.

## About project
I created it using only HTML, CSS. Project is really simple so there is not much witch responsiveness. It's just a card with qr code.

## Tips & Questions
If you have any tips let me know I would love having feedback.
**Things that I would appreciate the most would be any advice on styling**
